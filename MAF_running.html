<h1>Introduction and MAF running</h1><hr>
<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b>Brief Introduction.</b>  Hello everyone!  Welcome to my blog about my journey through MAF running.  Note that MAF is not to be confused with MATH, as I'm a mathematician by trade.  MAF stands for <b>M</b>aximum <b>A</b>erobic <b>F</b>itness, and was coined by Dr. Phil Maffetone, a famous endurance coach and exercise scientist. </p><hr>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b>Why do I care and why should you care about MAF running?</b> </p> 

<p><p style="font-size:20px">In order to understand the <i>why</i> behind this form of endurance training, it may be helpful to understand how I came to be interested in it.  To explain, I'll give you my personal history with running and the things that were happening in my life suggesting something needed to change.</p> 


<p><p style="font-size:20px">(1)  <i>Early personal successes with running for fun.</i>  Like many people, I came to the sport of long distance running a little later in life.  At first, I was a sprinter/middle distance runner in high school.  I did cross country half seriously as a senior in high school, and didn't start doing long distance running until graduate school in 2008.  At that time, I was just going out for timed runs, typically 30 minutes per run working up to 60 minutes daily.  I aimed to have as much fun as possible.  Eventually, I built in a long day, working up to 2 hours and 20 minutes for the long run.  The point is that, then, <b>I never cared about how fast I was running</b>.  I was just there to enjoy the scenery and listen to music on my iPod. I had no garmin or apple watch to track my pace and vitals.  It was just me, the road and some tunage.  Running this way felt great. </p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px">In November of 2008, I decided to run my first half marathon.  With very little knowledge of my progress and how I'd do,  I was hoping to finish under 2 hours.  To my surprise, I ran the race in 1 hour and 31 minutes, which is around 7 min/mile pace.  I was 24 years old and finished 3rd in my very small, 20-24 age group.  I still have the trophy from that race somewhere in my basement.  I have yet to improve upon this pace.</p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"> (2) <i>Life happens, continues to happen, so running changed for me.</i>  I continued to run freely as above until September of 2009, when I became a father for the first time. Along with the joys of becoming a dad was the serious time commitment it required.  Running for me at this point in life all but stopped, until  about 5 years later in the Summer of 2014 when I finally landed a permanent academic job in Iowa.  At this juncture, my now two kids (yes two) were getting more manageable, and felt like it was time to get back to it. </p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"> My return to long distance running took on a different form because of life's changes.  I was noticeable heavier (+20lbs from age 24 weight of 174lbs) because of the stresses from my job, and to be able to do the running, I had to put my kids into childcare at the local YMCA (which is amazing by the way, because they watch your kids for free for two hours per day if you're a member!).  Thus I ran exclusively on the treadmill.  My running philosophy changed due to time constraints and boredom on the treadmill.  I basically tried to run 4 miles/4 times per week.  Instead of running timed runs for fun, the way I could noticeably improve was to keep getting faster at the current distance, possibly adding a day or two on the treadmill.  Thus, in my mind, <b>faster was better</b>.  </p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"> This running pattern continued until January 2022, with a couple of intermittent months aside to train for a half marathon and a marathon.  During my usual training pattern, however, I would eventually add a fifth training day to my week; sometimes I would add .25--2 miles to my 4 mile run, with no logical reason for doing so. I did see quite a bit of progress in adopting this approach.  My weight went down to about +6 my 24 age weight.  I went from running 9:30 min/miles at the beginning to running under 30 minutes for a 4 mile session (slightly less than 7:30 min/mile pace).  In 2017, I ran the Des Moines half marathon in 1hr 35 mins (7:16 min/mile pace) and in 2019, I ran the Des Moines full marathon (my first and only) in 3hrs 36 mins (8:17 min/mile pace).  </p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px">(3)  <i>Life happened again, the pandemic happened, health issues.</i>  I went through a divorce in 2016-2017, which was rough.  Anyone who has done it will likely tell you the same, and they may tell you things you don't wish to hear.  I'll spare you the details.  In 2018, I was very fortunate to get remarried to my best friend.  This helped me feel well enough to try a marathon in 2019, as I briefly described in the previous paragraph.  Then, the pandemic hit and it sucked and it still sucks to this day. It's difficult for me to not think daily about a deadly virus creeping around every corner of my life, just waiting to add me or my loved ones to its list of victims.   I sensed this feeling so strong that I started feeling things, i.e. stress, in my body that I never felt before.  To me, it felt as if the world was collapsing.  At this time, I was much too into the news, keeping the horrible stats about new virus totals and death totals, all of which was horribly unhealthy.  Added to all this, I was going up for tenure at my job, which is the biggest hurdle in academia, and my wife was pregnant with twins (awesome, but also stressful).  I was lucky enough to secure tenure, but somehow it wasn't enough to curtail my body's feelings about stress.  </p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px">I continued my usual 4-5 days running at a brisk pace while my stress hit a high point, punctuated by severe arthritis in my left big toe, frequent throat clearing and an intermittent hoarse voice.  My toe pain was so severe I opted to have surgery in January 2022 to fuse the joint, i.e. no more joint, just a stiff toe.  After the full recovery period of three months which included lap swimming, I can still run similarly despite the noticeable scar on my foot and the hardware in it. I visited an ear, nose and throat doctor no too long after that to figure out my voice box; it seems I have GERD, i.e. reflux disorder, but I am improving with treatment.</p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px">(4) <i>A guy named Yuri.</i>  After all of the health issues, I  got myself back to where I was previously in my training using the same method as above.  I built my way back to around the same, faster pace, and I started running longer runs on Saturdays with the local <i>Capital Striders</i>.  This is a nice (the only) social event I partake in regularly.  On July 16th of 2022, I ran with the striders.  We were cruising along one of our usual runs and the length was 9 miles that day.  Around mile 7 or so moving at 7:45 min/mile pace on a very hot (73 F), very humid morning (~100%), this guy named Yuri runs next to me, having very little difficulty with the pace, not even breathing hard.  At the next water stop, I was feeling somewhat winded, wondering if I could continue on at that pace.  I looked down at my apple watch and my heart rate read 163 beats per minute, which is not too bad considering the circumstances.  Yuri tells me his heart rate is in the mid 130s and my jaw dropped.  "That's very low at such a pace on this very miserable day!" I told him.  After our run, Yuri explains to me that his fitness is all because of low heart rate training, which he has been doing for three years now and swears by it.  He told me to look up this guy named Jonathan Walton. </p>




<p><p style="font-size:20px">  A couple of days later, I read about Jonathan Walton.  He is one of the best marathoners in his 50s in the UK and has gone from running very respectable ~3:40 marathons to regularly running blistering ~2:30 marathons using low heart rate training in a matter of like 4 years.  During really long runs, even at a now staggering 5:50min/mile pace, he manages to keep his heart rate in a similar range to Yuri's (~135bpm)!  I was intrigued to say the least.  In the process, I also discovered MAF training, which is maybe more a way of living for endurance sports than just low heart rate training, although low heart rate training is the primary component.      

</p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px"> Fast forward a few days after that, I ordered and received via Amazon a copy of one of Phil Maffetone's books: <i>The Big Book of Endurance Training</i>.  After reading some of the book and the testimonials online, I'm now sold on low heart rate/MAF training, at least to the point where I want to give it an honest try to see if it works for me like it does for Yuri and Jonathan.   I feel like if you're a serious endurance runner, then why not? Almost all of us aren't Olympians.  What have we got to lose?!?  Plus, it claims to help reduce stress, especially stress brought on partially by <b>running too fast too often</b>, of which I am clearly guilty. Moreover, I even have personal evidence from my early days of endurance running that <b>running slow translates to running fast.</b></p><hr>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b> MAF running.</b> MAF running is simply the MAF method applied to the sport of endurance running. The idea behind MAF running is simple: run almost exclusively at lower heart rates during training.  Your precise heart rate range is determined by the <b><i>MAF maximum heart rate</i></b> defined below.  The goal is to stay in this range because it forces your body to do great things for endurance training.  Exercise scientists use terms such as <i>capillary/mitochondrial development</i> and <i>stroke volume</i>.  Following MAF running, you do all three of these wonderful things for your body optimally, thus leading to greater aerobic fitness and endurance running.  </p><hr>

<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b> What about speed?</b> Experience endurance runners often scoff at the idea of only doing slow runs below your MAF maximum heart rate.  It is true that you probably need to incorporate some faster runs even in marathon training.  The idea is to eventually build in speed work once your aerobic fitness improves, usually after 3-6 months of exclusively training in the MAF heart rate zone.  At that time, it's usually recommended to do no more than 20% speed work in a given week.  80% needs to be in the lower heart rates/MAF zone.  However, it seems that the MAF method almost suggests doing even less, especially if you're not progressing in you MAF runs.</p><hr>

*Indicates a "cheat day" where I didn't care about my heart rate.  This is usually for a social day with other runners, and there the pace is too quick to stay in the MAF heart rate zone.
