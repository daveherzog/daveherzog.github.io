<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="intro">Introduction</a>.</b>  Hello everyone!  Welcome to my blog about my journey through MAF running.  Note that MAF is not to be confused with MATH, as I'm a mathematician by trade.  MAF stands for <b>M</b>aximum <b>A</b>erobic <b>F</b>itness, and was coined by Dr. Phil Maffetone, a famous endurance coach and exercise scientist.  I see this blog both as something to help me track my progress through my version of the program, and perhaps help you, the reader.</p><hr>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="why">Why MAF running?</a></b>  In order to understand the <i>why</i> behind this form of endurance training, it may be helpful to understand how I came to be interested in it.  To explain, I'll give you my personal history with running and the things that were happening in my life suggesting something needed to change.</p> 


<p><p style="font-size:20px">(1)  <i>Early personal successes with running for fun.</i>  Like many people, I came to the sport of long distance running later in life.  In my youth in high school, I was a sprinter/middle distance runner.  I did cross country half seriously my senior year, and didn't start doing real long distance running until graduate school in 2008.  At that time, I was just going out for timed runs, typically 30 minutes per run working up to 60 minutes daily.  With the sole purpose of just getting in better shape, I wanted to make sure I was having as much fun as possible while burning significant calories.  Eventually, I built in a long day, working up to 2 hours and 20 minutes for the long run.  Then, <b>I never cared about how fast I was running</b>.  I was just there to enjoy the scenery and listen to music on my iPod. I had no garmin or apple watch to track my pace and vitals.  It was just me, the road and some tunage.  Running this way felt great. </p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px">After a few months of running, in November of 2008, I decided to run the Tucson Half Marathon.  With very little knowledge of my progress and how I'd do,  I was hoping to finish under 2 hours.  To my surprise, I ran the race in 1 hour and 31 minutes, which is around 7 min/mile pace.  I was 24 years old and finished 2nd in my very small, 20-24 age group.  I still have the trophy from that race somewhere in my basement.  I have yet to improve upon this pace.</p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"> (2) <i>Life happens, continues to happen, so running changed for me.</i>  I continued to run like this until around September of 2009, when I became a father for the first time. Along with the joys of becoming a dad was the serious time commitment it required.  Running for me at this point in life all but stopped.  I would get out a few times per month, but I struggled to make a habit of it the way I did previously. 

<br>

<br>

About 5 years passed before I would finally make my way back to regular running.  This was in the Summer of 2014 when I finally landed a permanent academic job in Iowa.  At this juncture, my now two kids (yes two) were getting more manageable, and felt like it was time to get back to it. My return to long distance running took on a different form because of life's changes.  I was noticeable heavier (+25lbs from age 24 weight of 170lbs; I'm a jolly 6'2" by the way) because of the stresses from my job and the absence of meaningful exercise.  Also, to be able to do the running, I had to put my kids into childcare at the local YMCA (which is amazing by the way, because they watch your kids for free for two hours per day if you're a member!).  Thus I ran exclusively on the treadmill.  Although I got back to it, my running philosophy shifted from before.  I'm not sure exactly why, but I basically tried to run 4 miles/4 times per week.  Instead of running timed runs for fun, the way I could noticeably improve was to keep getting faster at the current distance, possibly adding a day or two on the treadmill.  Thus, in my mind at the time, <b>faster was better</b>.  </p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"> This exercise philosophy, if you could call it that, continued until January 2022, with a couple of intermittent months aside to train for some sprint triathlons, a half marathon and a marathon.  During my usual training weeks, however, I would eventually add a fifth training day to my week; sometimes I would add .25--2 miles to my 4 mile run, with no logical reason for doing so. I did see quite a bit of progress in adopting this approach.  My weight went down to about +10 my 24 age weight.  I went from running 9:30 min/miles at the beginning to running under 30 minutes for a 4 mile session (slightly less than 7:30 min/mile pace).  In 2017, I ran the Des Moines half marathon in 1hr 35 mins (7:16 min/mile pace) and in 2019, I ran the Des Moines full marathon (my first and only) in 3hrs 36 mins (8:17 min/mile pace).  </p>

<p><p style="font-size:20px">(3)  <i>Life happened again, the pandemic happened, health issues.</i>  I went through a divorce in 2016-2017, which was rough.  Anyone who has done it will likely tell you the same, and they may tell you things you don't wish to hear.  I'll spare you the details.  In 2018, I was very fortunate to get remarried to my best friend.  This helped me feel well enough to try a marathon in 2019, as I briefly described in the previous paragraph.  Then, the pandemic hit and it sucked and it still sucks to this day. It's difficult for me to not think daily about a deadly virus creeping around every corner of my life, just waiting to add me or my loved ones to its list of victims.   I sensed this feeling so strong that I started feeling things, i.e. stress, in my body that I never felt before.  To me, it felt as if the world was collapsing.  At this time, I was much too into the news, keeping the horrible stats about new virus totals and death totals, all of which was horribly unhealthy.  Added to all this, I was going up for tenure at my job, which is the biggest hurdle in academia, and my wife was pregnant with twins (awesome, but also stressful).  I was lucky enough to secure tenure and our twins were born very happy and healthy.  Somehow, it wasn't enough to curtail my body's recognition and responses to stress.  </p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px">I continued my usual 4-5 days running at a brisk pace while my stress hit a high point, punctuated by severe arthritis in my left big toe, frequent throat clearing and an intermittent hoarse voice.  My toe pain was so severe I opted to have surgery in January 2022 to fuse the joint.  This means my left big toe no longer has a joint, but instead is more like a stiff piece of wood that somehow has to squeeze into shoes in place.  After the full recovery period of three months which included lap swimming, I can still run similarly despite the noticeable scar on my foot and the hardware in it. You'd be surprised how little you use your big toe joint when running long distance.  To figure out my throat clearing, I visited an ear, nose and throat doctor no too long after that to figure out my voice box; it seems I have GERD, i.e. reflux disorder, but I am improving with treatment.</p>



<p><p style="font-size:20px">(4) <i>A guy named Yuri.</i>  After all of the health issues, I  got myself back to where I was previously in my training using the same method as above.  I built my way back to around the same, faster pace, and I started running longer runs on Saturdays with the local <i>Capital Striders</i>.  This is a nice (the only) social event I partake in regularly.  On July 16th of 2022, I ran with the striders.  We were cruising along one of our usual runs and the length was 9 miles that day.  Around mile 7 or so moving at 7:45 min/mile pace on a very hot (73 F), very humid morning (~100%), this guy named Yuri runs next to me, having very little difficulty with the pace, not even breathing hard.  At the next water stop, I was feeling somewhat winded, wondering if I could continue on at that pace.  I looked down at my apple watch and my heart rate read 163 beats per minute, which is not too bad considering the circumstances.  Yuri tells me his heart rate is in the mid 130s and my jaw dropped.  "That's very low at such a pace on this very miserable day!" I told him.  After our run, Yuri explains to me that his fitness is all because of <b>low heart rate training</b>, which he has been doing for three years now and swears by it.  He told me to look up this guy named Jonathan Walton. </p>




<p><p style="font-size:20px">  A couple of days later, I read about Jonathan Walton.  He is one of the best marathoners in his 50s in the UK and has gone from running very respectable ~3:40 marathons to regularly running blistering ~2:30 marathons using low heart rate training in a matter of like 4 years.  During really long runs, even at a now staggering 5:50min/mile pace, he manages to keep his heart rate in a similar range to Yuri's (~135bpm)!  I was intrigued to say the least.  In the process, I also discovered MAF training, which is maybe more a holistic approach to endurance sports, although low heart rate training is the primary component.

<p><p style="font-size:20px"> Fast forward a few days after that, I ordered and received via Amazon a copy of one of Phil Maffetone's books: <i>The Big Book of Endurance Training</i>.  After reading some of the book and the testimonials online, I'm now sold on low heart rate/MAF training, at least to the point where I want to give it an honest try to see if it works for me like it does for Yuri and Jonathan.   I feel like if you're a serious endurance runner, then why not? Almost all of us aren't Olympians.  What have we got to lose?!?  Plus, it claims to help reduce stress, especially stress brought on partially by <b>running too fast too often</b>, of which I am clearly guilty. Moreover, I even have personal evidence from my early days of endurance running that <b>running slow translates to running fast.</b> </p><hr>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="whyblog"> Why this blog?</a></b> Well, primarily, because I wanted to carefully track my progress and a blog would force me to do it.  Plus, there's a lot of vlogs out there already on MAF stuff and, being old fashioned, I like to be able to read information instead of having to wait for someone else to tell it to me in long-winded, video choreographed pieces. Additionally, no one ever seems to want to give you a running plan for free.  It's criminal!  Below, I give you mine for free.</p><hr>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="what"> MAF running.</a></b> MAF running is simply the MAF method applied to the sport of endurance running. The MAF method applies to all other endurance sports.  The idea behind MAF running is simple: Run almost exclusively at lower heart rates during training.  Your precise heart rate range is determined by the <b><i>MAF maximum heart rate</i></b> defined below.  The goal is to stay in this range because it forces your body to do great things for endurance training.  Exercise scientists use terms such as <i>capillary/mitochondrial development</i> and <i>stroke volume</i>.  Following MAF running, you do all three of these wonderful things for your body optimally, thus leading to greater aerobic fitness and endurance running.  </p><hr>

<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name = "speed"> What about speed?</a></b> Almost all experienced endurance runners scoff at the idea of only doing slow runs below your MAF maximum heart rate.  It is true that you probably need to incorporate some faster runs even in marathon training.  The idea is to eventually build in speed work once your aerobic (MAF zone) fitness improves, usually after 3-6 months of exclusively training in the MAF heart rate zone.  At that time, it's generally recommended to do no more than 20% speed work in a given week.  80% needs to be in the lower heart rates/MAF zone.  However, the MAF method almost suggests doing even less, especially if you're not progressing in you MAF runs.</p><hr>




<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="MAF"> You MAF maximum heart rate and MAF zone.</a></b> To calculate your MAF maximum heart rate, start by taking (180-Your age)beats/min.  For me, this is 180-38=142.  Now, depending on your general health and well-being, you can either add to this figure (up to 5) or subtract from it according to his formula in the book.  He recommends being conservative with the maximum number.  I wasn't very conservative, so I pegged mine at 147.   Now, for the Max maximum range, the lower part of the range is 10 bpm less than your MAF maximum heart rate, so my range e.g. is (137-147)beats/min.  Now, the idea is to run BELOW your MAX maximum heart rate for the ENTIRETY of your run.  This has you usually starting out way below your range due to cardiac drift (i.e. your heart rate steadily increases throughout a constant exercise).  For example, I may start my run moving at a constant speed and, after about .5 miles, my heart rate may be 122 beats/min.  However, after 4 miles at this constant speed, my heart rate will raise and may raise to the middle or top of my MAF zone at 147 beats/min.  

<br>

<br>

How quickly your heart rate climbs depends on how fast your are running.  If you're running way too fast, you'll exceed your MAF zone quickly.  So, early on in MAF training, it takes some time to figure out the pace that works for you.  Note that it is usually very slow initially. </p><hr>



<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="slow">But what if my MAF zone has me running REALLY, REALLY SLOW!?!?</a></b> It should if you're aerobically, i.e. MAF zone, unfit like me.  The truth is you shouldn't worry because you're working a different system in your body than what we often work when doing our long distance runs.  But, it's the right system to work; we just run above it way too much, leading to overtraining, injury, and excessive bodily stress.  

Additionally, at this point, there's no need to compare yourself with others.  You can do that race day if you choose to.  This is a baseline training pace which is supposed to improve over time, so long as you let it.  

<br>
<br>

I've heard stories of professional athletes having to run 11 min/mile pace initially; Jonathan Walton above had to start running at 9:30-9:45 min/mile.  Now he's cruising at 5:50 min/mile in his MAF zone.  Yuri was at a 9:30 min/mile pace.  At the start of the program in a very controlled environment, i.e. the treadmill, I was capable of the 10:30s min/mile range; I've heard others running 13-15 min/miles.  Just stop worrying about your times and stick with it for enough time, at least 3-6 months, and see what happens.</p>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"> If you want an even more concrete example, in my first experience running long distance, I did ZERO speed work and still managed to run a 1 hr 31 min half marathon.  I only ran long and slow (60 mins/day 5 days per week, 40 mins on Sundays, up to 2hr 20 mins on Saturdays).  Seriously, these runs were very slow. </p><hr>

<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="science">Basic science behind MAF running.</a></b> The idea is to train your body to burn fat instead of sugar.  During an endurance race, fat is your primary source of fuel.  Unfortunately, many (most) of us train in a heart rate range that is not conducive to this, typically far above the threshold where we'll see maximum benefits. The MAF zone optimizes this for us.  Additionally, because most of us run too fast, we end up overtraining leading to fatigue and many unwanted consequences like surgery and health issues.  Running almost entirely in the MAF zone, you feel way better and avoid injuries and crap like what I was going through (and I'm sure others are too).</p><hr>


<p><p style="font-size:20px"><b><a name="blog"> Running Plan/Statistics/Comments.</a></b>  


<br>

<br>

<b>My plan.</b>  My plan is to run 5 days per week, with two rest days.  The "shorter" runs will be for around 60 mins and I will gradually build up the longer run to exceed 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I may also run around 90 minutes on Sundays, eventually.  So, 3 days around 60 minutes, one long day and one in between a long and a shorter run, eventually.  All of the runs will initially be in my MAF zone, except some cheating days which are specified below.  I plan to do a MAF test every other week on the treadmill to check my progress. 

<br>

<br>

If you aren't able to do this much running to start with, then don't!  I would start with staying below and in your MAF zone for 30 minutes, 4 times per week.  If you're feeling good, gradually, VERY GRADUALLY, build up.  Again, don't push it until your body is ready.  For many, staying in the MAF zone will be a brisk walk and this is perfectly fine.   

<br>

<br>

<b>Measurables at the beginning of the program.</b>  At the start of MAF training, I am 6'2" and weigh around 176 lbs.  My resting heart rate is usually between 60-62 beats/min.  This is measured using my apple watch, and I let the watch do its thing until the end of the day when I take it off before sleep and see what it is.  I usually observe it throughout the day, and I don't usually get very close to my resting heart rate until right before bedtime.

        <td>MAF test.  I ran at a constant rate of 5.7 miles/hour and aim to finish at the top of my MAF zone.  I don't really like to try to run every mile at the top of the zone.  It's annoying because you have to slow down significantly to prevent your heart rate from climbing further.  I prefer tracking progress this way because it's clear that if you do this, you can track your progress even better over time.  This is the benefit of running on the treadmill.  Outside, this would be very hard to do.  Also, I'm running on the treadmill because I find a lot of variation in pace due to weather variation.  Of course you're going to get faster in October here in Iowa!  It's much cooler and the humidity is less.  You can control these factors inside on a treadmill where the inside temperature is at least constant. </td>

He's funny because when during our runs with the group, he randomly pops out of the trees/bushes to join us.  You never know when he'll catch you!  He's also known to push the pace subtly.  We'll be running with him and all of a sudden we start feeling like we're going a bit too faster than before.  In any case, I think I've decided to avoid the group runs for a while.  They're just too fast for my HR now.  Also, I didn't feel good after the run.  Hot and humid days suck!</td>

I think avoiding higher heart rates is really helpful. Prior to starting this program, the last two years I've had difficulty relaxing.  Maybe a bit of overtraining syndrome?  I'm not a doctor, but I'm feeling pretty good, better than I have in a while.  Also, heart rate is reaching resting rate much quicker even today than yesterday.  I know I will plateau eventually, but I am really starting to feel like myself again.  Resting heart rate was 59 beats/min today.  </td>

In any case, looking back at one week, I am clearly almost exactly where I was HR wise but .2 miles/hour faster during the MAF test.  Seems like a good indicator that things are working as they should, but of course more data is needed to make such conclusions.  This is also why running on the treadmill as much as I do is good.  I may slow it down slightly to 5.8 miles/hour on Friday when I return to the YMCA again.  Resting heart rate is continually improving, in the sense that I reach it earlier on in the day.  This has really been the best thing so far about this program; my body feels more relaxed.  Resting heart rate for the day was 53 beats/min, way down! Again, it has been years since I measured that low.

I'll be curious to see how my running plan adjusts when we get to NC.  I'll have to incorporate biking to work in the mix, and thus reduce the number of run days probably to 4/week.  Today, resting HR already hit 55 in the morning, which is great.  I returned to the ENT doctor today and am getting in with a GI to continue my treatment/advisement.  PPIs seem to be helping somewhat, but I am hopeful this change to MAF running will make this problem go away too.  Because my body feels more relaxed, I'm thinking it could actually happen.
